    OPENAFS-SA-2019-003: ubik: Avoid unlocked ubik_currentTrans deref
    
    Currently, SVOTE_Debug/SVOTE_DebugOld examine some ubik internal state
    without any locks, because the speed of these functions is more
    important than accuracy.
    
    However, one of the pieces of data we examine is ubik_currentTrans,
    which we dereference to get ubik_currentTrans->type. ubik_currentTrans
    could be set to NULL while this code is running, so there is a small
    chance of this code causing a segfault, if SVOTE_Debug() is running
    when the current transaction ends.
    
    We only ever initialize ubik_currentTrans as a write transation (via
    SDISK_Begin), so this check is pointless anyway. Accordingly, skip the
    type check, and always assume that any active transaction is a write
    transaction.  This means we only ever access ubik_currentTrans once,
    avoiding any risk of the value changing between accesses (and we no
    longer need to dereference it, anyway).
    
    Note that, since ubik_currentTrans is not marked as 'volatile', some C
    compilers, with certain options, can and do assume that its value will
    not change between accesses, and thus only fetch the pointer value once.
    This avoids the risk of NULL dereference (and thus, crash, if pointer
    stores/loads are atomic), but the value pointed to by ubik_currentTrans->type
    would be incorrect when the transaction ends during the execution of
    SVOTE_Debug().

    OPENAFS-SA-2019-002: Zero all server RPC args
    
    Currently, our server-side RPC argument-handling code generated from
    rxgen initializes complex arguments like so (for example, in
    _RXAFS_BulkStatus):
    
        AFSCBFids FidsArray;
        AFSBulkStats StatArray;
        AFSCBs CBArray;
        AFSVolSync Sync;
    
        FidsArray.AFSCBFids_val = 0;
        FidsArray.AFSCBFids_len = 0;
        CBArray.AFSCBs_val = 0;
        CBArray.AFSCBs_len = 0;
        StatArray.AFSBulkStats_val = 0;
        StatArray.AFSBulkStats_len = 0;
    
    This is done for any input or output arguments, but only for types we
    need to free afterwards (arrays, usually). We do not do this for
    simple types, like single flat structs. In the above example, we do
    this for the arrays FidsArray, StatArray, and CBArray, but 'Sync' is
    not initialized to anything.
    
    If some server RPC handlers never set a value for an output argument,
    this means we'll send uninitialized stack memory to our peer.
    Currently this can happen in, for example,
    MRXSTATS_RetrieveProcessRPCStats if 'rxi_monitor_processStats' is
    unset (specifically, the 'clock_sec' and 'clock_usec' arguments are
    never set when rx_enableProcessRPCStats() has not been called).
    
    To make sure we cannot send uninitialized data to our peer, change
    rxgen to instead 'memset(&arg, 0, sizeof(arg));' for every single
    parameter. Using memset in this way just makes this a little simpler
    inside rxgen, since all we need to do this is the name of the
    argument.
    
    With this commit, the rxgen-generated code for the above example now
    looks like this:
    
        AFSCBFids FidsArray;
        AFSBulkStats StatArray;
        AFSCBs CBArray;
        AFSVolSync Sync;
    
        memset(&FidsArray, 0, sizeof(FidsArray));
        memset(&CBArray, 0, sizeof(CBArray));
        memset(&StatArray, 0, sizeof(StatsArray));
        memset(&Sync, 0, sizeof(Sync));

    OPENAFS-SA-2019-001: Skip server OUT args on error
    
    Currently, part of our server-side RPC argument-handling code that's
    generated from rxgen looks like this (for example):
    
        z_result = SRXAFS_BulkStatus(z_call, &FidsArray, &StatArray, &CBArray, &Sync);
        z_xdrs->x_op = XDR_ENCODE;
        if ((!xdr_AFSBulkStats(z_xdrs, &StatArray))
             || (!xdr_AFSCBs(z_xdrs, &CBArray))
             || (!xdr_AFSVolSync(z_xdrs, &Sync)))
                z_result = RXGEN_SS_MARSHAL;
    fail:
        [...]
        return z_result;
    
    When the server routine for implementing the RPC results a non-zero
    value into z_result, the call will be aborted. However, before we
    abort the call, we still call the xdr_* routines with XDR_ENCODE for
    all of our output arguments. If the call has not already been aborted
    for other reasons, we'll serialize the output argument data into the
    Rx call. If we push more data than can fit in a single Rx packet for
    the call, then we'll also send that data to the client. Many server
    routines for implementing RPCs do not initialize the memory inside
    their output arguments during certain errors, and so the memory may be
    leaked to the peer.
    
    To avoid this, just jump to the 'fail' label when a nonzero 'z_result'
    is returned. This means we skip sending the output argument data to
    the peer, but we still free any argument data that needs freeing, and
    record the stats for the call (if needed). This makes the above
    example now look like this:
    
        z_result = SRXAFS_BulkStatus(z_call, &FidsArray, &StatArray, &CBArray, &Sync);
        if (z_result)
            goto fail;
        z_xdrs->x_op = XDR_ENCODE;
        if ((!xdr_AFSBulkStats(z_xdrs, &StatArray))
             || (!xdr_AFSCBs(z_xdrs, &CBArray))
             || (!xdr_AFSVolSync(z_xdrs, &Sync)))
                z_result = RXGEN_SS_MARSHAL;
    fail:
        [...]
        return z_result;
