# Cell Aliases are meant to act like symlinks like "/afs/openafs.org -> oao"
# in root.afs, so sites relying on such a link for their cell can use dynroot.
# These aliases are set with "fs newalias", or read from
# /usr/vice/etc/CellAlias
#
# Formating for /usr/vice/etc/CellAlias is in the form
# <target> <alias>
# an example would be
# fnal.gov/common/usr usr
